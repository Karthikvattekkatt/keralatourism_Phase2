The mosque is remarkable for its architectural features. The mosque and its vast pond built in the past two decades have been constructed. The magnificent architectural architecture of the architecture elevates the majesty of the church. The mosque was constructed under the leadership of Maulana Yaqub Musali, a native of Mattannur in Kannur. The architectural styles of Kerala and Persia have been applied here. Inside the church, there are granite pillars with a meter tall and four-meter high. The mosque’s top corridor in three floors is completely made of wood. In the interior of the first mosque, there are also beautiful carvings.Diplomatic praise is remarkable.

                                There are no loudspeakers in the church where millions of people can meet the rituals. It is here that the mafia loudspeaker tries to get to know the imams of the movement, which leads the agitation. The mosque is considered to be more than five hundred years old. There are also many festivals here in Lala. Hundreds of days are given the same day. Devotees from all over the neighboring areas visit the 27th century to reach the grave.">
