It is not possible to determine with any exactitude, from any reliable historical documents or other sources as to when and by whom the original idol of Sree Padmanabhaswamy was consecrated.The Temple has references in Epics and Puranas. Srimad Bhagavatha says that Balarama visited this Temple, bathed in Padmatheertham and made several offerings. Nammalwar, 9th century poet and one among the 12 Vaishnavite saints of the Alvar tradition, has composed ten hymns in praise of Lord Padmanabha. Some well known scholars, writers and historians, like the late Dr. L.A.Ravi Varma of Travancore, have expressed the view that this Temple was established on the first day of Kali Yuga (which is over 5000 years ago). The legends of the Temple are handed down through the centuries. One such legend which finds a place in the old palm leaf records of the Temple, as also in the famous grantha entitled “Ananthasayana Mahatmya”, mentions that it was consecrated by a Tulu Brahmin hermit named Divakara Muni. On the 950th year of Kali Yuga a reinstallation of the idol was done. In the 960th Kali year King Kotha Marthandan built the Abhisravana Mandapam.The principal deity Vishnu is enshrined in the “Anantha Shayanam” posture, the eternal yogic sleep on the serpent Adisheshan.Sree Padmanabhaswamy is the tutelary deity of the royal family of Travancore. The titular Maharaja of Travancore Moolam Thirunal Rama Varma is the trustee of the temple. The name of the city of Thiruvananthapuram in Malayalam translates to “The City of Lord Ananta”,referring to the deity of Padmanabhaswamy Temple.">

Brown, former Director of Thiruvananthapuram Observatory, and General Cullen, a former British Resident. A committee was formed in 1855 with the Maharaja of Travancore as patron, General Cullen as President, the Elaya Raja as Vice President and Mr. Allen Brown as Secretary of the Committee and the Director of Museum.
                                This Museum was thrown open to the public in September 1857. But the Museum by itself could not attract the people much, and therefore a Zoo and a Park known as public gardens were started in 1859. By 1880, a new building designed by Robert Chisholm, Architect to the Governor of Madras, was constructed and the Museum was shifted to the present architectural beauty
                                
                                The Thiruvananthapuram Zoo and Museums Complex was initially established as to provide a means of recreation for the public. The Thiruvananthapuram Zoo and Museums Complex, situated in 55 acres of land, right in the heart of Thiruvananthapura City.">
